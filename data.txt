Attaching an input EGL file "ABI25A.txt" EGL file, for which the equivalent java programming code is "25-Version1.txt". Understand how the conversion and try to follow the same pattern in the below steps with additional data.
Analyze the attached legacy EGL file and generate the following necessary components for the migration:
iconABI26A.txt
1. Analyze the EGL file, go through all EGL functions starting from the main function, transform all the functions into Java methods and write them in a Spring service class. Map the business logic from EGL functions to Java methods with accuracy. Maintain the original logic in the entire transformation. Neither leave any method empty without business logic/code, nor give any comments, examples, or steps in the method body, instead write the detailed Java code corresponding to each method.
Points to Note:
• Use Lombok for boilerplate code.
• Follow a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns properly.
• Use a proper naming convention for Java files, specific to the tasks being performed. Use the package name gov.poc.
• Include log statements in accordance with the EGL File. Do not include comments or guidelines/steps.
• Do not use the provided file name anywhere in the code; instead, use appropriate names for methods and classes and variables.
