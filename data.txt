- invokeInitialVerif is the first step to verify individuals lawful presence in the country.  
- The first step is, it calls token service to get a valid token. It will first check for in-memory cache. if it is expired, it will get the token from the database. If still invalid, it generates a new one via the token service, caches it, and updates the database.  
- Once the token is acquired, the method constructs a request payload (InitialVerificationRequestSetType), capturing individual information like name, DOB, and document information like (I94, I756, etc.).  
- It then retrieves the endpoint URL, Bearer string, Message ID string, and XML configurations from properties and validates that all necessary properties are present, otherwise, it throws an exception.  
- Constructs the query parameter with the Bearer token, a unique Message ID (UUID), and the XML payload and prepares headers like `Authorization` (Bearer token), `Content-Type` (application/json), and hits the Post CMS endpoint.  
- The method expects the response to be returned in 14 seconds; otherwise, it will throw a Timeout exception.  
- Once the response is parsed into the `InitialVerificationResponseType` object, from which eligibility codes and other results are extracted, the method may call the resubmit service or close case service based on the response.


-Close Case service qill close the active case when the case is no more required.
-After the response from the VLP service is parsed and mapped into the InitialVerificationResponseType object, the method extracts details like eligibility codes and case numbers.
-If the verification is successful and no further action (e.g., resubmission) is required, the case is marked as complete.
- if there is valid case number available from this getter InitialVerificationResponseSetType.getCaseNumber it will CloseCaseOperation endpoint.
- This is also a Rest endpoint and it uses same headers and access token used to invoke initial verification service.
- The Response will resposne code and description. If it is succesfull closed, we will get HS000000 as response code and "Case closed successfully." as response description in case of failure we will get "Case closed successfully."  as resposne description.
