Child Care Provider Portal
The proposed Child Care Provider Portal will utilize Azure B2C for secure, self-service account registration and identity management. This mirrors the existing process implemented for authorized representatives in the No Wrong Door platform, where users create accounts and are approved through a DWSS Admin Portal. Upon approval, each provider will be assigned a Unique Personal Identifier (UPI), consistent with DWSS person-matching standards.

Role-based access control will restrict providers to only the features necessary for their function—such as managing provider details, submitting attendance, and viewing payment history. DWSS administrators will continue to manage approvals, user status, and access permissions through familiar admin screens. Although this portal does not integrate directly with PDS, it adheres to DWSS’s established administrative workflows, ensuring alignment with current operational standards and maintaining strong governance.

Child Care Family Portal (No Wrong Door)
The Child Care Family Portal will extend the existing No Wrong Door citizen experience without introducing new functionality or processes for end users. Families will register and authenticate using Azure B2C, just as current No Wrong Door users do. These accounts will follow the same role-based access model already in place, enabling families to upload documents, track eligibility, and view communications securely.

Administrative capabilities will remain unchanged—DWSS staff will manage family accounts, access policies, and profile updates using existing tools. As with other No Wrong Door users, child care families will not require PDS integration but will benefit from the same secure, scalable infrastructure already supporting DWSS citizen interactions.

Child Care Worker Portal
The modernized Worker Portal will retain integration with DWSS’s enterprise identity and access management infrastructure, including NetIQ Access Manager (NAM) for authentication and Novell eDirectory (LDAP) as the authoritative identity store. User roles and permissions will continue to be managed through the Personnel Database System (PDS).

This model ensures that worker access is tied directly to their job classification, office assignment, and responsibilities. Access control will continue to be enforced at a granular level—limiting visibility to only the data and actions necessary for each role. Administrators will manage user accounts, roles, and permissions through the existing security framework, supporting consistency, compliance, and operational efficiency across all DWSS offices and programs.

✍️ Suggested Summary Reference (for RFP use)
Note: The identity management and role-based access controls described above follow DWSS's current enterprise standards. Each portal—Provider, Family, and Worker—utilizes identity platforms and approval workflows consistent with existing DWSS security protocols. Please refer to the consolidated Identity and Access Management section for additional technical context and architectural consistency across all portals.
