We can use existing NOD workstream for PEBT notices as well. I think we can achieve this with minimal changes. We can discuss more in the call for pros and cons.
Please find the attached viso that I have put that how can we do the PEBT notice flow. But inorder to this end to end its better we have access to smartcomm server so we can avoid dependencies with dwss for quick deployments.
