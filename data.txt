Role-based security access process for Child Care Provider Portal 
The proposed Provider Portal will adopt a role-based access control model consistent with existing practices already in place within the Access Nevada Citizen Portal. Similar to the authorized representative workflow used today, providers will have the ability to self-register through a secure, mobile-friendly interface using Azure AD B2C. Once registered, DWSS staff will review and approve the accounts via a dedicated Admin Portal, ensuring that only verified providers gain access. As part of the approval process, the system will assign a Unique Personal Identifier (UPI) to each provider using their Tax ID (SSN/FEIN). Role based access will restrict providers to appropriate functions such as managing profiles, submitting attendance, or viewing payment information, while DWSS users will have secure access to administrative features for monitoring, approvals, and account management. This model reflects our understanding of existing DWSS processes and ensures consistency, security, and compliance. 

Role-based security access process for Child Care Family Portal 
The proposed approach for the Child Care Family Portal leverages the existing Access Nevada platform, which already supports citizen account creation and authentication through Azure AD B2C. Child care families will be treated as part of the broader citizen user base and will follow the same account creation, login, and role-based access model currently in place. There will be no changes to the user experience. Child care families will see the same features available to existing citizens, including document upload, eligibility tracking, communication management, and status updates. Role based access is enforced to ensure users only access information relevant to their profile, while DWSS administrators maintain full control over user roles, permissions, and access to portal functionality through existing administrative tools. 

Role-based security access process for Child Care Worker Portal 
The proposed Child care Worker Portal will continue to use the existing enterprise role-based security framework already established across DWSS systems. User authentication and authorization are managed through NetIQ Access Manager (NAM) in conjunction with Novell eDirectory (LDAP), ensuring centralized and secure user identity validation. Role assignments are driven by the Personnel Database System (PDS), which governs user access across programs based on job title, office assignment, and functional responsibilities. Access control will continue to be enforced at a granular level, restricting user visibility to screens, reports, and actions based on their assigned security roles. This ensures staff only have access to the information necessary for their tasks, in accordance with the least privileged principles. System administrators can continue to assign and manage roles within this existing infrastructure, supporting consistency, compliance, and operational efficiency across all DWSS office locations. 

comments
Section is quite verbose. Add a diagram to set the context with the different portals and Identity management systems, Admin Screens components and then explain then in brief.

We can use No Wrong Door as the term in place of Access Nevada

Rephrase. Say we propose to utilize Azure B2C. Azure AD and Azure B2C are 2 different products. In another line call out we have implemented Similar implementation is done for Auth Reps



DWSS Security and PDS for Child Care Provider Portal 
While the Provider Portal will not directly integrate with DWSS’s Personnel Database System (PDS), it will follow the proven administrative model currently in place for the Access Nevada Citizen Portal. Azure AD B2C will be used for identity and access management, allowing providers to register securely while enabling DWSS staff to approve, manage, and update user accounts through a centralized Admin Portal. During the approval process, the system will automatically generate a Unique Personal Identifier (UPI) for each provider, ensuring alignment with DWSS person matching standards. Administrative users will also have tools to reset passwords, assign roles, and oversee account activity in real time. This approach aligns with DWSS’s existing operational model, streamlining user management while maintaining strong security and governance controls. 

DWSS Security and PDS for Child Care Family Portal 
The Citizen Portal (Access Nevada) does not integrate with the DWSS Personnel Database System (PDS). however, it provides comprehensive administrative functionality through Azure AD B2C. The addition of child care families will not require any changes to the current administrative model. DWSS staff will continue to manage citizen accounts, roles, and access permissions using the existing toolset, including password resets, profile updates, and security policy enforcement. All system administration functions related to user access will remain consistent with current operations, ensuring a streamlined and familiar process for both DWSS administrators and citizens. 

DWSS Security and PDS for Child Care Worker Portal 
The solution will maintain and extend integration with DWSS’s enterprise identity and access management infrastructure, including Novell eDirectory (LDAP), NetIQ Access Manager (NAM), and the Personnel Database System (PDS). User identities are authenticated through NAM, which brokers access to system resources using credentials stored and managed in the centralized eDirectory. Role based permissions are defined and managed through PDS, ensuring that user access aligns with personnel records and organizational responsibilities. Administrators will be able to manage roles, modify permissions, and monitor user access using existing tools and processes. This tightly integrated security model ensures uniform access control across the Worker Portal and broader DWSS application ecosystem, supporting secure operations, auditability, and compliance with agency security policies. 

 
Same comment as ROLE BASED Security. Too verbose. Both can be responded together and just acknowledge the requirement here and redirect to earlier section for details.
