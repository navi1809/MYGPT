Salesforce has its own system of user authentication. It also offers existing single sign-on capability to simplify and standardize their user
authentication. It provides two options to implement single sign-on:
 Federated authentication using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
 Delegated authentication
Salesforce supports the OpenID Connect protocol. When an authentication provider is enabled, Salesforce doesn’t validate a user’s password.
The login credentials of the user is used to establish authentication credentials.
We propose that CitizenCONNECT use existing LDAP servers in Nevada. Salesforce can be integrated for authentication with LDAP
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server or use a token instead of a password for authentication.
Delegated authentication is managed at the permission level, and not at the organization level, providing more flexibility. With permissions,
delegated authentication is used by some users while others use their Salesforce-managed password. Benefits of delegated authentication to
Nevada include:
 A stronger form of user authentication, such as integration with a secure identity provider
 Private login page and accessible only behind the State’s firewall
 Differentiation of organization from all other companies that use Salesforce to reduce phishing attacks
All users and application-level security are defined and maintained by the CitizenCONNECT administrator. Sharing model sets the default
access that users have to each other's data. There are four sharing models:
 Private. Only the record owner, and users above that role in the hierarchy, can view, edit, and report on those records.
 Public Read Only. Users can view and report on records but not edit them. Only the owner, and users above that role in the hierarchy, can
edit those records.
 Public Read/Write. Users can view, edit, and report on records.
 Public Read/Write/Transfer. Users can view, edit, transfer, and report on records. Only available for cases or leads.




The proposed solutions authorization and authentication will be managed through DWSS’s existing PDS and provide role-based access to users.
