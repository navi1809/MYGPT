As Phase II lead for the ESU Modernization project ($12.18M), I managed a 30-member team migrating 200 components (Benefit Issuance, Case Management, Interfaces, Reports, Worker Portal) from mainframe to Java and Crystal Reports. The project is in UAT and on track for Feb 2026 go-live, enabling full legacy decommissioning and long-term cost savings. Post go-live, I am planning staffing, knowledge transfer, and operations to transition into Phase II M&O and prepare for Phase III. In parallel, I managed Child Care and Medicaid M&O ($2.15M+), leading two 5-member teams delivering monthly releases on fixed timelines. With strong technical and functional expertise, I engage clients on critical decisions and correspondence solutions. I also drove effective adoption of Copilot and AI-assisted development practices, guiding teams toward reduced manual coding, improved productivity, and faster delivery while maintaining quality and compliance.
