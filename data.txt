The candidate showed a basic understanding of Java concepts but struggled with explaining more advanced topics clearly. They answered simple string comparison questions correctly but did not provide satisfactory explanations. There were issues with understanding transactional annotations, `WHERE`, and `HAVING` clauses, and they couldnâ€™t give proper examples for some of these. Questions involving exceptions were not handled well, with incorrect or incomplete answers. While they answered correctly for streams and collections, the explanations were delayed and not well-justified, especially for tricky cases like modifying a list during iteration. Overall, they have basic knowledge but need to improve their clarity, speed, and depth in explaining complex topics.
