Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each Excel formula, explaining references like `$E`, `$L`, and why we use specific numbers in the formulas.

---

### **1. Start Date Formula**
```excel
=VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], Reports!$E:$S, 16, FALSE)
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **`[@[Part Details]]`**: Refers to the "Part Details" in the current row of the "Progress Tracker" sheet. This is the lookup value.
  
- **`Reports!$E:$S`**: Refers to columns **E** to **S** in the "Reports" sheet where data is stored:
  - **`$E`**: This is **Part Details** in the "Reports" sheet. This is the lookup column where the function will search for a match.
  - **`$S`**: This is **End Date**, the last column in the lookup range.
  
- **`16`**: This indicates that **Start Date** is the 16th column when counting from column **E** to column **S**:
  - E (1), F (2), G (3)... S (16)

- **`FALSE`**: This means Excel will only return exact matches.

---

### **2. End Date Formula**
```excel
=VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], Reports!$E:$S, 17, FALSE)
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **`[@[Part Details]]`**: Looks for the "Part Details" from the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
  
- **`Reports!$E:$S`**: Searches the "Reports" sheet from column **E** (Part Details) to column **S** (End Date).
  
- **`17`**: This indicates **End Date**, which is the 17th column in this range.

- **`FALSE`**: Ensures exact matches only.

---

### **3. % Complete Formula**
```excel
=VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], Reports!$E:$L, 7, FALSE)
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **`[@[Part Details]]`**: Looks for the current row's "Part Details" in "Progress Tracker."
  
- **`Reports!$E:$L`**: Searches in the "Reports" sheet from **E** (Part Details) to **L** (% Complete).
  
- **`7`**: This means that **% Complete** is the 7th column when counting from **E** to **L**:
  - E (1), F (2), G (3)... L (7)

- **`FALSE`**: Ensures exact matches only.

---

### **4. Expected Progress Formula**
```excel
=IF(AND(TODAY() >= [@[Start Date]], TODAY() <= [@[End Date]]), 
   ROUND(((TODAY()-[@[Start Date]]+1) / ([@[End Date]]-[@[Start Date]]+1))*100, 2), 
   IF(TODAY()<[@[Start Date]], 0, 100))
```

#### **Explanation:**
1. **`TODAY()`**: Returns todayâ€™s date.

2. **First Condition:** Check if todayâ€™s date is between **Start Date** and **End Date**:
   ```excel
   AND(TODAY() >= [@[Start Date]], TODAY() <= [@[End Date]])
   ```
   - If `TRUE`, calculate expected progress:
     ```excel
     ROUND(((TODAY()-[@[Start Date]]+1) / ([@[End Date]]-[@[Start Date]]+1))*100, 2)
     ```
   - `TODAY()-[@[Start Date]]+1`: Number of days completed since the start date.
   - `[@[End Date]]-[@[Start Date]]+1`: Total project duration in days.
   - `*100`: Converts progress into a percentage.
   - `ROUND(..., 2)`: Rounds the result to 2 decimal places.

3. **Second Condition:** 
   - If todayâ€™s date is **before** the start date â†’ Progress = 0%.
   - If todayâ€™s date is **after** the end date â†’ Progress = 100%.

### **5. Daily Progress Formula**
```excel
=[@[% Complete]] - IFERROR(VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], 'Progress Tracker'!$E:$I, 5, FALSE), 0)
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **`[@[% Complete]]`**: Current progress for this row from the "Progress Tracker" sheet.

- **`VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], 'Progress Tracker'!$E:$I, 5, FALSE)`**:
  - Looks up the same "Part Details" in the previous day's data from columns **E** to **I** in "Progress Tracker."
  - **`5`**: The 5th column in this range, assuming this holds **% Complete** from the previous day.

- **`IFERROR(..., 0)`**:
  - If **Part Details** is not found in the previous day's data, default to `0%` progress.

---

### **6. Variance Formula**
```excel
=[@[% Complete]] - [@[Expected Progress]]
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **`[@[% Complete]]`**: Actual progress reported by the developer.
- **`[@[Expected Progress]]`**: Progress that should have been completed by now.
  
**Result:**
- Positive Value â†’ Ahead of schedule
- Zero â†’ On schedule
- Negative Value â†’ Behind schedule

### Key Takeaways:
- **`$E:$L` or `$E:$S`**: Refers to fixed column ranges in the "Reports" sheet, ensuring Excel looks only in these columns.
- **Column Numbers (7, 16, 17)**: Specify the position of relevant columns within the lookup range.
- **`FALSE` in VLOOKUP**: Ensures only exact matches are returned.
- **Structured References (`[@[Column Name]]`)**: Refers dynamically to the table columns in the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
