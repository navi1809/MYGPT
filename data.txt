I've noticed the driver query for the AIF30A batch is loading around 15k records every time, which seems off. On checking, the Discovery Date or Delinquent Dates in the data go back as far as 1996, which likely means we're pulling all records each time instead of just the relevant ones. We should look into why this is happening and update the query if needed to avoid loading unnecessary data every run.
