To create an accurate development estimate for integrating **MDP (Master Client Index)** into the **Worker Portal**, consider the following factors:

### **1. Understanding the Integration Scope**
   - **MDP Features**: What functionalities of MDP need to be integrated? (e.g., search, create, update, sync client data)
   - **Worker Portal Compatibility**: Is the Worker Portal built in a way that easily allows API or database integrations?
   - **Authentication & Security**: Does MDP require authentication, and do we need role-based access in the Worker Portal?
   - **Data Sync & Real-time Updates**: Will the data be fetched on demand (via API) or stored locally and synchronized?

### **2. Technical Aspects to Estimate**
| **Task** | **Estimated Effort (Hours/Days)** | **Notes** |
|----------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| **Requirement Analysis** | 8-16 hours | Understanding MDP API, data structures, and security requirements |
| **MDP API Integration Setup** | 16-24 hours | Connecting Worker Portal with MDP via REST/SOAP API |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | 8-16 hours | Ensuring secure access to MDP |
| **Data Mapping & Transformation** | 16-24 hours | Aligning MDP data with Worker Portal structures |
| **UI/UX Enhancements (if needed)** | 16-40 hours | Implementing new UI components for search, view, edit features |
| **Error Handling & Logging** | 8-16 hours | Managing API failures, validation errors, and logging mechanisms |
| **Testing (Unit + Integration)** | 16-32 hours | Validating integration with MDP |
| **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Support** | 16-24 hours | Assisting stakeholders in validation |
| **Deployment & Post-Go-Live Support** | 8-16 hours | Deploying integration to production & resolving issues |

### **3. Additional Considerations**
- **Tech Stack Dependencies**: If the Worker Portal is built on a legacy system, integration complexity increases.
- **API Rate Limits & Performance Testing**: If MDP has restrictions on requests per minute, caching or batching strategies may be needed.
- **Compliance & Data Privacy**: Ensure adherence to GDPR, HIPAA, or other relevant regulations.
- **Dependencies on External Teams**: If API changes require collaboration with the MDP team, allow buffer time.

### **4. High-Level Estimation Summary**
| **Phase** | **Effort Estimate (Days)** |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Analysis & Design | **3-5 days** |
| Development | **10-15 days** |
| Testing & UAT | **5-8 days** |
| Deployment & Support | **3-5 days** |
| **Total Estimated Time** | **21-33 days (~4-7 weeks)** |
