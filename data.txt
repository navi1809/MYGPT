Summary
 
 
This article details FOP's support for the arabic language.
 
Arabic text is written from right to left in a cursive style with some letters joined. When previewing a template using the Simplified Arabic true type font the Arabic characters display in reverse order and are not joined uniformly.
 
 
 
 
 
Resolution

Currently, the FOP Renderer does not support Arabic since it cannot successfully render arabic fonts.
 
Specifically FOP does not implement the bidirectional(bidi) algorithms, which is why the characters are displayed the wrong way around. Also, FOP does not yet implement glyph merging or shaping. But, we have taken this up as an enhancement and will be implementing it in the next major build of NOW.
 
NOW v6.0 and v6.1 now supports bidirectional text.
