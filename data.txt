ur solution will leverage DWSS’s application security framework PDS and offers customizable role-based access control, allowing DWSS to define user roles and permissions based on their responsibilities. This ensures that users have appropriate access to the features and reports and views they need. Least privilege access approach will be applied to all roles and users


F.4.1.J. Authentication and Authorization
The Workload Management Solution shall provide robust security through comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms. Deloitte will utilize DWSS-provided, identity and authentication management solutions to implement single sign-on functionality using SAML federation.
Role-Based Authorization: To control access and permissions, a least privilege policy will be implemented so users have access only to the information and tasks relevant to their role. This can be configured through integrating the workload management solution with DWSS PDS for managing security settings.


F.6.3. Aligning with the DWSS Service Delivery Model Requirements
The instance of the workload management solution will be configured and managed to align perfectly with DWSS service delivery model requirements. This includes ensuring that the system is tailored to the state office structure, and managing user configurations, roles, and responsibilities through integrating the workload management solution with DWSS’s PDS.
•	State Office Structure:
o	Configuring DWSS offices and supervisory units within offices.
o	Enabling office managers to move tasks within their office.
o	Allowing field operations managers to move tasks between different offices.
•	User Configurations/Role(s) and Responsibilities:
o	Seamlessly integrating with existing DWSS roles (e.g., FMxx, QCxx, IRxx).
•	Customer Unique Identifier (UPI):
o	Providing the ability to search by UPI, application number, SSN, and phone number.
•	Customer First and Last Names:
o	Providing the ability to search by customer first and last names including “sounds like” (Soundex) match.


CitizenConnect provides appropriate user access controls using profiles,
roles and permission sets. It includes a least-privileged role-based security
scheme that is compatible and interoperable with the established DHHS
Divisional security scheme.


The proposed solutions authorization and authentication will be managed through DWSS’s existing PDS and provide role-based access to users.
