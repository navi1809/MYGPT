Sreenath
-----------------------------
Abhilash
he is pretty good, handled complex integratiosn having concurreny implenationsm, vendor implementation, 1st one for completeing phase 2.
from footlocker also supports.
communicated to clients directly, BI people.
12 plus integrations independently single handedly
good quality
he takes clarity before implementing.
frontloaded few integrations, completed well ahead. performance increased and license by using less connectiors and built scripts. 



scope : Development, its in .net everthing, future scope using bhoomi middleware products,new technologies, 
new apis related to deloitte tax business, payroll, imigrations. will sell these to other vendors. HRS related

Complexity : started this year march, initally we do POCs, once requirements comes in , based on integartion catalog, various simple intergartion, cmpex or middleware
. includes all varieties. going forward it will be more high complexity
quality of work: took all pocs, without any dependencies. very good quality so far
impact created whenever team stuck anywhere helped by writing custom java scripts. % memebrs team, only sreenath has that knowledge.
utlizing AI effeciently.


Kaushik
-------------------

Scope - handling one complete track. and helping 2 more tracks, assisting junior members as well. 
Complexity, high complexity, API testting involves reaching out to different teams , 
whenever story comes , immediatly start, no dependency with lead handles independently that helps leads a lot
recognized for outsatnding award, developed a regression suite, which automates major part of testing. he alone made this work. connected and showed to project leadership and got appreciation
he is already performing at next level.

Shivani
----------------
I’m consistently performing at the next-level expectations.
Over time, I’ve expanded my scope of ownership and demonstrated end-to-end accountability across multiple areas, including the Primary Contact for EDI.
For functional enhancements proposed in my tracks, I independently handle design, impact analysis, coming up with a variable technical approach and solution, furthermore I implement these changes into the system singlehandedly.
I also proactively identify gaps, collaborate across teams, and ensure smooth outcomes even in complex scenarios.
Key examples from this ongoing performance year include:
1. Migration of EDI from BizTalk to Azure Integration Services.
2. Automated the process of Issuer Reinstatement.
3. Designed and developed a dispute resolution system between CMS, State, and Issuer.
4. Handled complete Passive Renewals from EDI perspective, providing quick delivery of performance and other critical bugs.
5. Extensively contributed to data fixes, for the Prod issues which needed immediate work around.
Overall, I feel my performance, technical depth, and functional understanding are already aligned with the next-level role expectations.
Outside my daily assignments, I've contributed in the following ways:
1. Supported the State of New York team, to understand the EDI workflow and its integration with Issuer Portal.
2. Continuously share my learnings with the team, over our team DL, which anyone can refer as and when needed.
3. Conducted knowledge transfer sessions on EDI concepts and workflows.
4. Helped new teammates setup EDI solutions in their local machines in a running state.
Yes, I've helped my team grow by:
1. Guided them on technical and functional expectations, and how to implement the changes for multiple change requests, which helped them gain EDI workflow knowledge.
2. Helped teammates from other tracks with technical blockers and guided them on how to approach the solution as and when needed.
My utilization goal was set at 89%, and I've achieved 100%.

1. E-Commerce (Pod A) – UI Testing & Agile Adaptation


I have provided guidance to junior practitioners when they encounter technical or functional challenges, ensuring they met project-specific deadlines, while simultaneously completing my own tasks.
I developed an automated smoke suite using JavaScript and enhancing it into a regression suite. This significantly reduced the effort needed to validate API functional scenarios and improved the overall validation process for the APIs.
I have provided KT to the E-commerce team to help them understand the API functionality and the gaps between systems and mentored the junior practitioner’s when they encounter any technical or functional challenges.
I have met and exceeded the metrics goals.


2.Common Spirit Health

I have reviewed the junior practitioners option code configuration and provided guidance whenever they have a huddle in incorporating the health plan benefits into the EZcap system, ensuring they meet project-specific deadlines, while simultaneously completing my own tasks.
I provided knowledge transfer sessions on benefits configuration to new joiners, which empowered the team members to work independently on these configurations. Additionally, I reviewed the new practitioner's option code configurations to ensure they aligned with client quality standards and deadlines.
Provided guidance to the junior practitioners in the team whenever they have a huddle in incorporating the health plan benefits into the EZcap system, simultaneously corrected their mistakes in the configurations.
I have met and exceeded the metrics goals.
