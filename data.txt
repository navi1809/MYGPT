Features	"Potential Functional Requirements
(Pending Policy Decisions)"
14) Notices & Forms	"Develop and update system-generated notices and forms to clearly communicate
C-E requirements, exemptions, compliance status, and consequences for non-compliance to beneficiaries. These updates should support timely and accurate
delivery of information throughout the beneficiary lifecycle, including from
application to redetermination, to disenrollment and appeal. Notices should align
with the CE verification and determination logic, include appropriate 30-day period
to address non-compliance language, and ensure beneficiaries understand their
rights and responsibilities. This task also involves the creation of new CE-specific
notice templates and the modification of existing forms and correspondence to
include CE content.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"13) Marketplace
Coordination"	"Update Medicaid-Marketplace coordination processes to ensure accurate and
policy-compliant implementation of C-E requirements.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"12) Increased Frequency
of Renewals &
Compliance Checks"	"Update the business processes to support more frequent renewals and ongoing
and recurring assessments of C-E compliance. States must evaluate an
individual’s participation in qualifying activities (e.g., work, school, volunteering) on
a more frequent basis (at least every 6 months). The system should support
scheduling, retrieving, and processing updated information from verification
sources and determine whether a beneficiary remains in compliance or should be
flagged for further action. This logic should be repeatable, auditable, and
integrated with downstream processes such as notice generation, exemption
review, cure periods, and disenrollment.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
15) Outreach	"Enhance outreach and communication functionality to notify beneficiaries of C-E
requirements, rights, and responsibilities. Systems should identify applicable
individuals based on enrollment and CE implementation timelines, generate initial
notices 4–6 months before compliance begins (depending on the state’s review
period), and support recurring outreach at defined intervals. Notices must be
delivered by mail unless electronic delivery is elected and should be reinforced
through at least one additional channel (e.g., text, portal, or managed care plan
communication). Where possible, depending on modality, all required outreach
should be logged for either audit or reporting purposes, support language access
requirements, and allow workers to view notice history and confirm delivery prior to
adverse action.

These functionality expectations currently include:"
01) Application	"Modify the state’s MAGI-based applications (e.g., health coverage-only
applications, multi-benefit applications, and, where applicable, presumptive
eligibility forms) to support C-E requirements. The updates should ensure CErelated
questions collect information to conduct necessary verifications, and
request/collect supporting auditable self-declaration documentation at the point of
application and integrated into downstream eligibility determinations and system
logic.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"04) Caseworker Portal &
Case Management
Updates"	"Update the state’s caseworker portal and/or case management systems to support
manual review and intervention when CE-related eligibility determinations cannot
be fully resolved through automated processes. While core CE logic will apply at
application, renewal, and changes in circumstances, often without worker
interaction, systems must also allow caseworkers to view CE-related fields, review
documentation, and initiate or override workflows when required. These
capabilities are essential for cases that require manual verification, exemption
adjudication, or appeals processing, and must be fully integrated with the
underlying eligibility logic to ensure consistency across automated and workerassisted
scenarios.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"06) Citizen or Client
Portal"	"Develop application, change reporting, and renewal workflows in the citizen portal
to support C-E requirements, including the ability for beneficiaries to report
qualifying activities and identify applicable exemptions. The portal should guide
users through CE-related questions, allow manual reporting of hours across work,
education, or volunteer service, and accept auditable self-declaration
documentation when formal verification is unavailable. It could display real-time CE
compliance status, upcoming deadlines (e.g., renewals), and provide user-friendly
CE education and guidance that meets accessibility standards. Where appropriate,
the portal should also facilitate referrals to employment, education, or volunteer
support programs and track outcomes.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
02) Audits	"Implement auditing and recordkeeping capabilities across eligibility, compliance,
and case management systems to support oversight of C-E determinations,
exemptions, verifications, and adverse actions. Systems must ensure that each
individual’s case record contains the required documentation to substantiate
eligibility decisions, consistent with federal recordkeeping requirements. All CE-related evidence must be retained in an auditable, accessible format to support
QA, appeals, and audits, including PERM.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"16) Verification Logic &
Exemption
Assessment"	"Design and implement system logic to electronically verify C-E activity and
exemption status using reliable data sources. Systems must assess whether
individuals meet CE requirements (such as hours worked, enrollment in education
or training programs, or participation in community service) using existing wage,
enrollment, and program data. They must also verify exemption status based on
available information, including claims data (e.g., medically frail), application data
(e.g., pregnancy or caregiving), data from other programs (i.e., SNAP, TANF), and
residence/geolocation data to identify individuals residing in areas affected by
disasters or high unemployment. CE status evaluations should occur at
application, renewal, and change in circumstance events, and systems must apply
exemptions for the correct timeframe with controls to manage effective dates and
geographic parameters. Where electronic verification is insufficient, the system
should trigger workflows for caseworks to request documentation and apply the
appropriate compliance tracking logic.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
18) Fair Hearings	"Update caseworker and citizen portals to support changes to fair hearing
processes related to C-E-related adverse action. As states implement CE
requirements, beneficiaries will need the ability to request a fair hearing of an
adverse action related to C-E.
These functionality expectations for E&E systems currently include:"
"09) Data Exchange
(education data
exchange - new)"	"Expand the state’s data exchange infrastructure to support the secure
transmission and receipt of C-E-related information across eligibility systems,
Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), MMIS, T-MSIS, FDSH, and external
sources such as employment and education systems. This includes exchanging
data on CE participation (e.g., hours worked, enrollment in school or training
programs) to support initial eligibility determinations, renewals and ongoing
compliance checks. These updates must ensure reliable, auditable data integration
to automate verification where possible and reduce manual burden on
beneficiaries and staff.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"10) Eligibility
Determination Logic"	"Develop and implement new eligibility determination logic specific to the C-E
requirements for expansion adults enrolled or potentially eligible under the state
plan Medicaid adult group or applicable Section 1115 demonstrations. This logic
should assess whether individuals are subject to CE, determine if they meet
compliance thresholds (e.g., 80 hours/month of work, school, or volunteering), and
evaluate exemptions and exclusions. The system will also support triggering
requests for verification, determine when additional information is required, apply
30-day period logic to address non-compliance, and process disenrollment dates if
non-compliance is confirmed.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"08) Data Analytics &
Reporting"	"Enhance the state’s data analytics and reporting infrastructure to track and
evaluate C-E implementation, compliance trends, exemption patterns,
disenrollments, and program outcomes. These updates may require integration of
CE data elements into data warehouses, development of CE-specific dashboards,
and creation of standard reports for CMS oversight and internal management.
Systems should also reflect updates to Performance Indicators (PI) to incorporate
CE-related metrics. States should ensure alignment with T-MSIS and other federal
reporting systems.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"11) Ex Parte Renewal
Logic"	"Revise and expand ex parte renewal logic to assess CE compliance and
exemption status using available data sources for expansion individuals in the
state plan Medicaid adult group or applicable individuals in Section 1115
demonstrations. If CE status cannot be confirmed through ex parte, the system
should trigger a pre-populated renewal form and follow state system and business
logic for processing a renewal form. This logic must align with broader renewal
determination processes and support downstream actions like notices. Updates
should ensure consistent application of CE policy without requiring unnecessary
worker intervention.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"05) Change in
Circumstance
Updates"	"Update eligibility systems to apply C-E logic when beneficiaries report changes in
circumstances or a state using a periodic data match identifies a change that may
affect eligibility, including compliance or exemption status. The system must
recalculate CE status in real time, trigger notices, initiate cure period tracking if
applicable, and follow the appropriate eligibility pathway. These updates help
maintain program integrity by ensuring individuals are neither improperly
disenrolled nor incorrectly exempted from CE requirements.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
03) Call Center	"Revise and develop call center scripts, worker guidance, and automated call tree
options to support accurate and consistent communication about C-E
requirements. As CE is implemented, applicants and beneficiaries will have
questions about the requirement to meet community engagement requirements,
including questions regarding the applicability of the requirement, exemptions,
qualifying activities, compliance tracking, documentation, and disenrollment.
Systems should be updated to reflect CE terminology in automated messages,
routing logic, and worker-facing FAQs. Caseworkers and customer service
representatives should also be equipped with clear scripts and escalation
procedures to respond to inquiries and provide assistance.
These functionality expectations currently include:"

options to support accurate and consistent communication about C-E
requirements. As CE is implemented, applicants and beneficiaries will have
questions about the requirement to meet community engagement requirements,
including questions regarding the applicability of the requirement, exemptions,
qualifying activities, compliance tracking, documentation, and disenrollment.
Systems should be updated to reflect CE terminology in automated messages,
routing logic, and worker-facing FAQs. Caseworkers and customer service
representatives should also be equipped with clear scripts and escalation
procedures to respond to inquiries and provide assistance.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"11) Ex Parte Renewal
Logic"	"Revise and expand ex parte renewal logic to assess CE compliance and
exemption status using available data sources for expansion individuals in the
state plan Medicaid adult group or applicable individuals in Section 1115
demonstrations. If CE status cannot be confirmed through ex parte, the system
should trigger a pre-populated renewal form and follow state system and business
logic for processing a renewal form. This logic must align with broader renewal
determination processes and support downstream actions like notices. Updates
should ensure consistent application of CE policy without requiring unnecessary
worker intervention.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
18) Fair Hearings	"Update caseworker and citizen portals to support changes to fair hearing
processes related to C-E-related adverse action. As states implement CE
requirements, beneficiaries will need the ability to request a fair hearing of an
adverse action related to C-E.
These functionality expectations for E&E systems currently include:"
02) Audits	"Implement auditing and recordkeeping capabilities across eligibility, compliance,
and case management systems to support oversight of C-E determinations,
exemptions, verifications, and adverse actions. Systems must ensure that each
individual’s case record contains the required documentation to substantiate
eligibility decisions, consistent with federal recordkeeping requirements. All CE-related evidence must be retained in an auditable, accessible format to support
QA, appeals, and audits, including PERM.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"16) Verification Logic &
Exemption
Assessment"	"Design and implement system logic to electronically verify C-E activity and
exemption status using reliable data sources. Systems must assess whether
individuals meet CE requirements (such as hours worked, enrollment in education
or training programs, or participation in community service) using existing wage,
enrollment, and program data. They must also verify exemption status based on
available information, including claims data (e.g., medically frail), application data
(e.g., pregnancy or caregiving), data from other programs (i.e., SNAP, TANF), and
residence/geolocation data to identify individuals residing in areas affected by
disasters or high unemployment. CE status evaluations should occur at
application, renewal, and change in circumstance events, and systems must apply
exemptions for the correct timeframe with controls to manage effective dates and
geographic parameters. Where electronic verification is insufficient, the system
should trigger workflows for caseworks to request documentation and apply the
appropriate compliance tracking logic.

"04) Caseworker Portal &
Case Management
Updates"	"Update the state’s caseworker portal and/or case management systems to support
manual review and intervention when CE-related eligibility determinations cannot
be fully resolved through automated processes. While core CE logic will apply at
application, renewal, and changes in circumstances, often without worker
interaction, systems must also allow caseworkers to view CE-related fields, review
documentation, and initiate or override workflows when required. These
capabilities are essential for cases that require manual verification, exemption
adjudication, or appeals processing, and must be fully integrated with the
underlying eligibility logic to ensure consistency across automated and workerassisted
scenarios.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"05) Change in
Circumstance
Updates"	"Update eligibility systems to apply C-E logic when beneficiaries report changes in
circumstances or a state using a periodic data match identifies a change that may
affect eligibility, including compliance or exemption status. The system must
recalculate CE status in real time, trigger notices, initiate cure period tracking if
applicable, and follow the appropriate eligibility pathway. These updates help
maintain program integrity by ensuring individuals are neither improperly
disenrolled nor incorrectly exempted from CE requirements.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"10) Eligibility
Determination Logic"	"Develop and implement new eligibility determination logic specific to the C-E
requirements for expansion adults enrolled or potentially eligible under the state
plan Medicaid adult group or applicable Section 1115 demonstrations. This logic
should assess whether individuals are subject to CE, determine if they meet
compliance thresholds (e.g., 80 hours/month of work, school, or volunteering), and
evaluate exemptions and exclusions. The system will also support triggering
requests for verification, determine when additional information is required, apply
30-day period logic to address non-compliance, and process disenrollment dates if
non-compliance is confirmed.

transmission and receipt of C-E-related information across eligibility systems,
Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), MMIS, T-MSIS, FDSH, and external
sources such as employment and education systems. This includes exchanging
data on CE participation (e.g., hours worked, enrollment in school or training
programs) to support initial eligibility determinations, renewals and ongoing
compliance checks. These updates must ensure reliable, auditable data integration
to automate verification where possible and reduce manual burden on
beneficiaries and staff.

Reporting"	"Enhance the state’s data analytics and reporting infrastructure to track and
evaluate C-E implementation, compliance trends, exemption patterns,
disenrollments, and program outcomes. These updates may require integration of
CE data elements into data warehouses, development of CE-specific dashboards,
and creation of standard reports for CMS oversight and internal management.
Systems should also reflect updates to Performance Indicators (PI) to incorporate
CE-related metrics. States should ensure alignment with T-MSIS and other federal
reporting systems.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
"06) Citizen or Client
Portal"	"Develop application, change reporting, and renewal workflows in the citizen portal
to support C-E requirements, including the ability for beneficiaries to report
qualifying activities and identify applicable exemptions. The portal should guide
users through CE-related questions, allow manual reporting of hours across work,
education, or volunteer service, and accept auditable self-declaration
documentation when formal verification is unavailable. It could display real-time CE
compliance status, upcoming deadlines (e.g., renewals), and provide user-friendly
CE education and guidance that meets accessibility standards. Where appropriate,
the portal should also facilitate referrals to employment, education, or volunteer
support programs and track outcomes.
