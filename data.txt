#### **Title:** Integration of Medical Expenses from Client Database to Staging Tables in Auto Registration Process

---

### **Objective**
To explain the recent modifications in the `SelfServiceAppRegBO` Java class that ensure medical expenses data submitted via the client-facing application is transferred to the staging tables during the Auto Registration batch process.

---

### **Background**
In the previous implementation, medical expense data entered in the client-facing application was saved only in the client database tables. When the Auto Registration batch process was run, this data was not being copied to the staging tables, causing discrepancies in the application's data flow. The missing integration led to incomplete processing of medical expense records during registration.

---

### **Solution: Modified Code**
To address this issue, two sets of modifications were made in the code:

1. **Lines 610–615**: Invocation of the `buildT1019AppInMedE` method to process medical expense data.
   ```java
   try {
       buildT1019AppInMedE(xmlDoc.getRootElement());
   } catch (Exception e) {
       log(ILog.ERROR, "Exception occurred while Inserting a record in T1019AppInMedE :: " + e.getMessage(), e);
       errorMessages.append("|T1019AppInMedE:" + e.getMessage());
   }
   ```

2. **Lines 1178–1220**: Implementation of the `buildT1019AppInMedE` method to handle the logic for transferring medical expenses from the root XML element to the staging table (`T1019AppInMedE`).
   ```java
   private void buildT1019AppInMedE(Element root) throws Exception {
       T1019AppInMedECargo t1019Cargo = null;
       T1019AppInMedECollection t1019Coll = null;
       Element medExpenses = root.getChild("APP_IN_MED_E");
       List medExpensesList = (medExpenses != null ? medExpenses.getChildren("APP_IN_MED_E") : null);
       try {
           if (medExpensesList != null && medExpensesList.size() > 0) {
               log(ILog.DEBUG, "entered SelfServiceAppRegBO.buildT1019AppInMedE method");
               t1019Coll = (conn == null) ? new T1019AppInMedECollection() : new T1019AppInMedECollection(conn);
               Iterator ite = medExpensesList.iterator();
               while (ite.hasNext()) {
                   Element medExpense = (Element) ite.next();
                   String dataExist = (medExpense.getAttribute(AppRegConstants.DATA_EXIST) != null)
                       ? medExpense.getAttribute(AppRegConstants.DATA_EXIST).getValue().trim()
                       : DATA_NO;

                   if (DATA_YES.equalsIgnoreCase(dataExist)) {
                       t1019Cargo = new T1019AppInMedECargo();
                       t1019Cargo.setIndvSeqNum(getIntForString(medExpense.getChildTextTrim("INDV_SEQ_NUM")));
                       t1019Cargo.setSeqNum((short) 1);
                       t1019Cargo.setEffBegMo(getIntForString(medExpense.getChildTextTrim("EFF_BEG_MO")));
                       t1019Cargo.setFreqCd(getCharForString(medExpense.getChildTextTrim("FREQ_CD")));
                       t1019Cargo.setMedExpAmt(getDoubleForString(medExpense.getChildTextTrim("MED_EXP_AMT")));
                       t1019Cargo.setMedExpTyp(getString(medExpense.getChildTextTrim("MED_EXP_TYP")));
                       t1019Cargo.setMedExpAmtInd(getLongForString(medExpense.getChildTextTrim("MED_EXP_AMT_IND")));
                       t1019Coll.setCargo(t1019Cargo);
                   }
               }
               if (t1019Coll.size() > 0) t1019Coll.insert(t1019Coll);
           }
       } catch (RuntimeException e) {
           log(ILog.ERROR, "Exception in SelfServiceAppRegBO.buildT1019AppInMedE method: " + e.getMessage(), e);
           throw new Exception("Exception in buildT1019AppInMedE method: " + e.getMessage(), e);
       }
       log(ILog.DEBUG, "exiting SelfServiceAppRegBO.buildT1019AppInMedE method");
   }
   ```

### **Impact**
With the added code:
- **Medical Expense Data Integration**: Data submitted via the client-facing application under medical expenses is now processed and copied to the `T1019AppInMedE` staging table during the Auto Registration batch process.
- **Improved Data Consistency**: Ensures that all relevant data is available in the staging tables for subsequent processing and reporting.
- **Error Handling**: Includes comprehensive error logging to identify issues during the record insertion process.

---

### **Implementation Workflow**
1. **Data Submission**:
   - Medical expense data is captured in the client-facing application.
   - Data is stored in the respective client database tables.
2. **Auto Registration Batch Execution**:
   - The batch process invokes the `buildT1019AppInMedE` method as part of the workflow.
   - The method iterates over the XML data and inserts records into the `T1019AppInMedE` staging table.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Testing**:
   - Validate the integration by submitting medical expense data through the client-facing application and running the Auto Registration batch process.
   - Verify that the records are accurately reflected in the staging tables.
2. **Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor logs for any errors in the new implementation.
   - Address issues proactively to ensure uninterrupted functionality.
