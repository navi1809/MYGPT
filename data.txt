I led the Modernization Phase I project, migrating critical mainframe modules to Java. Managing a 25-member team, I oversaw the transition of the Posting module, Eligibility Data Loader, and Worker Portal Screens, ensuring business continuity. My team executed key batch processes like Mass Change and Carry Forward, boosting efficiency and reducing manual work. This modernization resulted in 150K cases posted, 350K eligibility determinations, and 0.6M monthly eligibility extensions, delivering substantial business value. Currently, I lead a 22-person team for NOMADS Modernization Phase II, overseeing the migration of benefit issuance, case management, interfaces, and reports to Java and Crystal Reports. With 60% of batch processes migrated, the project is on track to decommission the legacy system. Additionally, I manage 6-member M&O teams for Child Care and Medicaid systems, handling policy-driven CRs, production fixes, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
