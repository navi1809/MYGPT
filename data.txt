Tarun was unable to answer several core Java questions, particularly those involving static method behavior, increment operators, and HashMap key handling. While he provided partially correct answers on SQL-related questions, his understanding appeared superficial. He also lacked clarity on Spring Boot behaviors (such as REST responses) and ORM concepts like missing @Id in a JPA @Entity. Notably, he did not attempt or respond to questions related to transaction management, which is a critical area for backend roles.

Interview Recommendation:
Based on the gaps in core Java, Spring, and database understanding, I recommend not moving forward to the next interview round.
