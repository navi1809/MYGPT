Based on the actual columns in your **Reports** sheet, let me correct and explain each **VLOOKUP** formula in detail:

---

### **Corrected VLOOKUP Formulas**
1. **% Complete Formula**
   ```excel
   =VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], Reports!$E:$M, 8, FALSE)
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `[@[Part Details]]`: Looks for the current rowâ€™s **Part Details** from the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
   - `Reports!$E:$M`: Refers to columns **E** (Part Details) to **M** (% Complete) in the "Reports" sheet.
   - `8`: Refers to the 8th column within the range **E** through **M**, where **% Complete** is located.
   - `FALSE`: Ensures an exact match.

---

2. **Start Date Formula**
   ```excel
   =VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], Reports!$E:$S, 15, FALSE)
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `[@[Part Details]]`: Looks for the **Part Details** in the current row of the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
   - `Reports!$E:$S`: Refers to columns **E** (Part Details) through **S** (End Date).
   - `15`: Refers to the 15th column in the range, where **Start Date** is located.
   - `FALSE`: Ensures only exact matches are considered.

---

3. **End Date Formula**
   ```excel
   =VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], Reports!$E:$S, 16, FALSE)
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `[@[Part Details]]`: The current rowâ€™s **Part Details** in the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
   - `Reports!$E:$S`: Refers to columns **E** to **S** in the "Reports" sheet.
   - `16`: Refers to **End Date**, which is the 16th column in this range.
   - `FALSE`: Ensures exact matches.

---

4. **Expected Progress Formula**
   ```excel
   =IF(AND(TODAY() >= [@[Start Date]], TODAY() <= [@[End Date]]), 
      ROUND(((TODAY()-[@[Start Date]]+1) / ([@[End Date]]-[@[Start Date]]+1))*100, 2), 
      IF(TODAY()<[@[Start Date]], 0, 100))
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `TODAY()`: Returns the current date.
   - `[@[Start Date]]` and `[@[End Date]]`: Refer to the Start Date and End Date for the current row in the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
   - `AND(TODAY() >= [@[Start Date]], TODAY() <= [@[End Date]])`: Checks if todayâ€™s date falls between the start and end dates.
   - `ROUND(((TODAY()-[@[Start Date]]+1) / ([@[End Date]]-[@[Start Date]]+1))*100, 2)`: Calculates expected progress as:
     - `(TODAY() - [@[Start Date]] + 1)`: Days passed since the project started.
     - `([@[End Date]] - [@[Start Date]] + 1)`: Total project duration in days.
     - `*100`: Converts progress into a percentage.
   - `ROUND(..., 2)`: Rounds to 2 decimal places.
   - `IF(TODAY()<[@[Start Date]], 0, 100)`: Sets the progress to 0% if today is before the start date or 100% if today is after the end date.

---

5. **Daily Progress Formula**
   ```excel
   =[@[% Complete]] - IFERROR(VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], 'Progress Tracker'!$E:$I, 5, FALSE), 0)
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `[@[% Complete]]`: Actual progress as entered in the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
   - `VLOOKUP([@[Part Details]], 'Progress Tracker'!$E:$I, 5, FALSE)`: Looks for the previous day's progress from **% Complete** in the "Progress Tracker" sheet.
   - `IFERROR(..., 0)`: Returns 0% if the previous dayâ€™s progress is not found.
   - This calculates how much progress was made since the previous day.

---

6. **Variance Formula**
   ```excel
   =[@[% Complete]] - [@[Expected Progress]]
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `[@[% Complete]]`: The actual completion percentage entered by the developer.
   - `[@[Expected Progress]]`: The expected progress as calculated from the start and end dates.
   - **Result:**
     - Positive value â†’ Ahead of schedule.
     - Zero â†’ On track.
     - Negative value â†’ Behind schedule.

### Summary of Columns Reference:
- **E:** Part Details (Lookup Key)
- **M:** % Complete (Column 8 in E:M range)
- **R:** Start Date (Column 15 in E:S range)
- **S:** End Date (Column 16 in E:S range)
