## **1) Client Impact**

Krishnam Raju has delivered strong client impact through technical ownership, rapid upskilling, and consistent delivery on complex Java migration initiatives. Since joining the project in January, he quickly established himself as an SME in Java Apache Camel and independently led the migration of 6+ complex integrations from legacy Red Hat Fuse to Apache Camel, improving system performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability. He was one of the first to initiate and drive server and service migrations, taking ownership of end-to-end execution.

He successfully delivered critical Java services including Pricing and RMS services, independently developing, testing, and deploying them to production. For a highly complex RMS integration, he owned the integration with an external vendor system involving 30+ API touchpoints, proactively coordinating with vendors and improving response time by ~20% using modern Java features. He also resolved 50+ BAU/XSLT mappings and stabilized operations by leading rapid triage of Java defects with an average turnaround time of 12 hours. His ownership, quality, and client focus earned direct client appreciation and formal Spot and Applause awards.
