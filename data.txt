Hereâ€™s a concise feedback summary you can use:

---

The candidate demonstrated a strong understanding of Java fundamentals, including inheritance, operator precedence, collections behavior (like handling `null` keys in `HashMap`), and immutability in strings. They answered most of the core Java questions correctly, showing confidence in syntax and behavior-based questions.

They also showed good familiarity with Spring annotations such as `@RestController` and `@GetMapping`, and correctly identified behavior around lazy loading and HTTP mappings. However, while they recognized the code was "theoretically correct" in one case, they missed mentioning the appropriate HTTP status code for a `null` response, which is a minor but important detail in REST API design.

Some areas to probe further include:  
- Understanding of JPA requirements, such as the necessity of an `@Id` in `@Entity` classes.  
- The correctness and implications of repository method signatures, like returning `void` in `deleteByName`, and potential behavior in case of no entity found.  
- Exception handling in repository access (e.g., use of `.get()` without checking `isPresent()`).

Overall, the candidate is technically sound and well-prepared for a backend Java/Spring role. With minor improvements in JPA usage and RESTful practices, they can be a strong asset to the team.
