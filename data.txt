"This document is intended to describe the systems and operational changes that states may need to consider to
implement and administer the statutory community engagement (C-E) requirements. It represents CMS’ preliminary
systems and operational considerations as of mid-December 2025 related to implementation of Section 71119 of the
WFTC legislation and does not establish new federal mandates or prescribe a single operating model. It organizes
common Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) eligibility and enrollment-related components and functions (e.g., online
portals, eligibility worker tools, call centers, and notice generation) and how they can be configured to support C-E
implementation. It represents a baseline and may be updated as needed to reflect lessons learned and additional policy
decisions and guidance.
States retain the flexibility to design workflows, channels, and subsystems that fit their existing infrastructure and policy
choices. Not every function described will be required or relevant in every state. Some capabilities reflect underlying
statutory or regulatory obligations (e.g., accepting online applications and renewals), while others are presented as
alternative approaches or leading practices that can help states achieve compliance while improving beneficiary
experience, monitoring, and program integrity over time."

"16) Verification Logic &
Exemption
Assessment"	"Design and implement system logic to electronically verify C-E activity and
exemption status using reliable data sources. Systems must assess whether
individuals meet CE requirements (such as hours worked, enrollment in education
or training programs, or participation in community service) using existing wage,
enrollment, and program data. They must also verify exemption status based on
available information, including claims data (e.g., medically frail), application data
(e.g., pregnancy or caregiving), data from other programs (i.e., SNAP, TANF), and
residence/geolocation data to identify individuals residing in areas affected by
disasters or high unemployment. CE status evaluations should occur at
application, renewal, and change in circumstance events, and systems must apply
exemptions for the correct timeframe with controls to manage effective dates and
geographic parameters. Where electronic verification is insufficient, the system
should trigger workflows for caseworks to request documentation and apply the
appropriate compliance tracking logic.
These functionality expectations currently include:"	40) Accept auditable self-declaration documentation across modalities (online, mail, phone, in person) through secure upload and create workflows to support manual review of documentation by eligibility workers
"17) Volunteer and Work
Program Data
Sources (new)
Expand"	"Expand data exchange infrastructure to support the flow of C-E-related information
for workforce programs and volunteering. States will need to securely transmit and
receive data related to CE participation (e.g., hours worked, hours in school
program) to support eligibility determinations and ongoing compliance checks. In
the absence of electronic verification through volunteer or work program related
data sources, systems should enable applicants or beneficiaries to report time
spent on these activities and enable documentation upload to verify this reporting."	01) N/A

These functionality expectations for E&E systems currently include:"	61) Sharing fair hearing status with the eligibility system through defined data interfaces or workflows










"Expand the state’s data exchange infrastructure to support the secure
transmission and receipt of C-E-related information across eligibility systems,
Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), MMIS, T-MSIS, FDSH, and external
sources such as employment and education systems. This includes exchanging
data on CE participation (e.g., hours worked, enrollment in school or training
programs) to support initial eligibility determinations, renewals and ongoing
compliance checks. These updates must ensure reliable, auditable data integration
to automate verification where possible and reduce manual burden on
beneficiaries and staff.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
10) Developing interfaces to receive CE data from workforce systems, volunteer platforms
20) Establishing real-time or batch processing schedules for CE data ingestion
30) Monitoring and log all CE-related data exchanges for audit and appeals purposes
40) The ability to access SNAP and TANF data for the purpose of determining CE compliance.
"10) Eligibility
Determination Logic"
"Develop and implement new eligibility determination logic specific to the C-E
requirements for expansion adults enrolled or potentially eligible under the state
plan Medicaid adult group or applicable Section 1115 demonstrations. This logic
should assess whether individuals are subject to CE, determine if they meet
compliance thresholds (e.g., 80 hours/month of work, school, or volunteering), and
evaluate exemptions and exclusions. The system will also support triggering
requests for verification, determine when additional information is required, apply
30-day period logic to address non-compliance, and process disenrollment dates if
non-compliance is confirmed.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
10) Identify applicants or beneficiaries subject to CE requirements
11) Eligible for or enrolled under the state plan in the adult group described in §1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII)
12) Eligible to enroll or is enrolled in a section 1115 demonstration that provides minimum essential coverage (MEC), and who are at least 19 and under 65 years of age, not pregnant, not entitled to or enrolled for benefits under Medicare Part A or Part B, and not otherwise eligible to enroll under the state Medicaid plan
13) Does not meet the requirements of the mandatory exceptions and exclusions as detailed in Section 71119
20) Confirm applicant or beneficiary is compliant with work requirements in the state’s TANF program OR is a member of a household receiving SNAP benefits and is not exempt from SNAP work requirements
30) For individual subject to CE requirements who were not determined to be compliant with TANF’s requirements and not a member of a household receiving SNAP, use available electronic data sources to evaluate whether their income meets $580 monthly minimum OR (if they are a seasonal worker) has at least the average monthly income over the preceding 6- month period
40) If they do not meet the minimum income threshold, determine whether they meet the following requirements (in part or in combination):
41) Work at least 80 hours as verified though an electronic data source or documentation
42) Be enrolled in an educational program at least half-time as verified though an electronic data source or documentation
43) Complete at least 80 hours of community services as verified though a self-declaration under penalty of perjury
44) Participate in a work program for at least 80 hours verified though a self-declaration under penalty of perjury
45) Any combination of the 4 requirements above that equals 80 hours
50) If a state is unable to verify an applicant or beneficiary meets CE requirements, the state must provide notice of non-compliance and provide the individual 30 days to make a satisfactory showing that they meet the requirement or that they are excluded from the requirement. For beneficiaries, eligibility must be maintained during this period.
60) If applicants fail to provide the requested information or required auditable self-declaration that makes a satisfactory showing, the state must deny the application. For beneficiaries that fail to provide the requested information or required auditable self-declaration that makes a satisfactory showing, the state must terminate coverage not later than the month following the month in which the 30-day period ends. States must consider eligibility on all bases prior to determining an individual is ineligible or terminating coverage.
"11) Ex Parte Renewal
Logic"
"Revise and expand ex parte renewal logic to assess CE compliance and
exemption status using available data sources for expansion individuals in the
state plan Medicaid adult group or applicable individuals in Section 1115
demonstrations. If CE status cannot be confirmed through ex parte, the system
should trigger a pre-populated renewal form and follow state system and business
logic for processing a renewal form. This logic must align with broader renewal
determination processes and support downstream actions like notices. Updates
should ensure consistent application of CE policy without requiring unnecessary
worker intervention.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
10) Integrating CE compliance and exemption checks into existing ex parte workflows
20) Evaluating available data sources to determine CE status during renewal
30) Routing beneficiaries to appropriate eligibility pathways (e.g., streamlined, manual, pending verification)
40) Triggering the generation of pre-populated renewal forms when ex parte processing is not possible
50) Assessing CE compliance in the appropriate time period and thresholds to determine renewal eligibility
60) Logging CE status changes for audit and reporting purposes
70) Coordinating with notice systems to inform beneficiaries of renewal outcomes and next steps if beneficiary’s eligibility can be renewed on an ex parte basis.
"12) Increased Frequency
of Renewals &
Compliance Checks"
"Update the business processes to support more frequent renewals and ongoing
and recurring assessments of C-E compliance. States must evaluate an
individual’s participation in qualifying activities (e.g., work, school, volunteering) on
a more frequent basis (at least every 6 months). The system should support
scheduling, retrieving, and processing updated information from verification
sources and determine whether a beneficiary remains in compliance or should be
flagged for further action. This logic should be repeatable, auditable, and
integrated with downstream processes such as notice generation, exemption
review, cure periods, and disenrollment.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
01) Define CE compliance check frequency and integrate with redetermination timelines
02) Incorporate CE verification logic into renewal processes both at the ex parte phase and when a renewal form is sent
03) Route non-compliant individuals to workflows that initiate notices or 30-day non-compliance cure periods
04) Evaluate exemption status at each renewal and apply appropriate logic
05) Store compliance history and exemption status to support decision-making and appeals
06) Trigger generation of pre-populated renewal forms or manual review tasks if CE status is unclear
"13) Marketplace
Coordination"
"Update Medicaid-Marketplace coordination processes to ensure accurate and
policy-compliant implementation of C-E requirements.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
01) Coordinate with Marketplace systems (FFM or SBM) to maximize use of existing data sent through the outbound AT payload to help the state evaluate community engagement.
14) Notices & Forms
"Develop and update system-generated notices and forms to clearly communicate
C-E requirements, exemptions, compliance status, and consequences for non-compliance to beneficiaries. These updates should support timely and accurate
delivery of information throughout the beneficiary lifecycle, including from
application to redetermination, to disenrollment and appeal. Notices should align
with the CE verification and determination logic, include appropriate 30-day period
to address non-compliance language, and ensure beneficiaries understand their
rights and responsibilities. This task also involves the creation of new CE-specific
notice templates and the modification of existing forms and correspondence to
include CE content.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
01) Add new notice for outreach (initial and periodic) and non-compliance for CE
02) Update verification checklist and eligibility approval or denial notices to reflect CE status
03) Design outreach and renewal notices with CE language
04) Include CE verification and exemption information in standard templates
15) Outreach
"Enhance outreach and communication functionality to notify beneficiaries of C-E
requirements, rights, and responsibilities. Systems should identify applicable
individuals based on enrollment and CE implementation timelines, generate initial
notices 4–6 months before compliance begins (depending on the state’s review
period), and support recurring outreach at defined intervals. Notices must be
delivered by mail unless electronic delivery is elected and should be reinforced
through at least one additional channel (e.g., text, portal, or managed care plan
communication). Where possible, depending on modality, all required outreach
should be logged for either audit or reporting purposes, support language access
requirements, and allow workers to view notice history and confirm delivery prior to
adverse action.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
01) Identify applicable individuals based on enrollment and CE implementation timeline
02) Generate initial outreach notices 4–6 months before the CE compliance start date, based on the state’s selected 1-, 2-, or 3-month review period
03) Schedule recurring outreach at state-defined intervals after implementation
04) Deliver notices by regular mail unless the individual has opted for electronic communication
05) Support at least one supplemental outreach channel (e.g., text, portal message, phone call, MCO communication)
06) Log outreach events and delivery methods for audit and compliance tracking
07) Support language access and accessibility requirements per federal standards
08) Display outreach history and contact preferences in worker portals to ensure notices are issued before adverse action
"16) Verification Logic &
Exemption
Assessment"
"Design and implement system logic to electronically verify C-E activity and
exemption status using reliable data sources. Systems must assess whether
individuals meet CE requirements (such as hours worked, enrollment in education
or training programs, or participation in community service) using existing wage,
enrollment, and program data. They must also verify exemption status based on
available information, including claims data (e.g., medically frail), application data
(e.g., pregnancy or caregiving), data from other programs (i.e., SNAP, TANF), and
residence/geolocation data to identify individuals residing in areas affected by
disasters or high unemployment. CE status evaluations should occur at
application, renewal, and change in circumstance events, and systems must apply
exemptions for the correct timeframe with controls to manage effective dates and
geographic parameters. Where electronic verification is insufficient, the system
should trigger workflows for caseworks to request documentation and apply the
appropriate compliance tracking logic.
These functionality expectations currently include:"
10) Automatically attempt to verify CE compliance using available electronic data (e.g., wage records, training enrollment, program participation) before prompting a request for auditable self-declaration documentation from the applicant or beneficiary
20) Automatically attempt to verify CE mandatory exemptions and exclusions using available electronic data (e.g., application data, claims, Veterans Administration, SNAP, TANF) before prompting a request for auditable self-declaration documentation from the applicant or beneficiary
30) Automatically attempt to verify whether applicant or beneficiary qualifies for short-term hardship exemption using available electronic data (e.g., residence/geolocation to confirm an individual resides in a county or equivalent unit of local government under a Presidentially declared emergency or disaster)
31) Apply exemption status for the relevant time period, with controls to manage start/end dates and affected localities
40) Accept auditable self-declaration documentation across modalities (online, mail, phone, in person) through secure upload and create workflows to support manual review of documentation by eligibility workers
18) Fair Hearings
"Update caseworker and citizen portals to support changes to fair hearing
processes related to C-E-related adverse action. As states implement CE
requirements, beneficiaries will need the ability to request a fair hearing of an
adverse action related to C-E.
These functionality expectations for E&E systems currently include:"
10) Capturing CE-specific appeal reason codes at the time an appeal is initiated
20) Enable tracking of CE-related adverse actions (e.g., exemption denied, non-compliance)
30) Routing requests to the appropriate state fair hearing entity or external system
40) Suspending or reversing CE-related adverse actions while a fair hearing is pending, in accordance with due process
50) Receiving CE-related fair hearing outcomes and applying system logic to update eligibility status accordingly
60) These functionality expectations for fair hearing systems currently include: 
61) Sharing fair hearing status with the eligibility system through defined data interfaces or workflows
