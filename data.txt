"Daily bulk upload of active SNAP participants to NAC - 
1. A batch to pick all the SNAP data as per the selection criteira and convert all the data to a secure cryptographic hash through a Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) process.
2. A batch to write the records to a .csv file.
3. Transfer the file to the NAC server using the upload information API and get the status of the uploaded file."

If the NAC was triggered successfully in current day, then NAC will not be triggered again. The screen should display the latest run result. (If a match is found within the ‘X’ days, we will not be triggering NAC). Add validations to restrict/allow NAC calls.
Add changes to the current task closure batch to close PARIS match task when a NAC match is received. ****
Add Security Mapping for New screen - Role

"The National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) is an innovative technology solution designed to prevent Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants from receiving benefits in multiple states. NAC aims to improve program integrity, customer experience, reduce improper payments, and ensure fair distribution of SNAP benefits across state lines.

As part of NAC implementation, the below 3 NAC services must be integrated with the IE systemm in three phases. The phase 1 integration with NAC will cover only the Bulk Upload Information Service. 

Bulk Upload Information Service:
A daily file is sent to NAC with the list of all active SNAP participants along with a unique encrypted hash ID. NAC will have a repository of active SNAP participants data from all the states.  
Duplicate Participant Query Service:
Real-time or on-demand call to NAC will be triggered from the eligibility system on all case modes for a SNAP application. If a match is identified, a response is received, and initial action is taken in the system which includes pending eligibility and sending of RFI notice.
Match Resolution Service:
Upon verifying the proof provided by the client, worker will update the initial and final action taken for the case in the IE System and a real time call will be made to update NAC with the details."
