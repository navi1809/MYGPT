The batch program AIN29A processes Social Security Number (SSN) verification requests for IV-A and IV-D individuals by reading input data from various database tables. The primary trigger for this batch process is data inserted into the TWNFAM_TRGR_TBL, which is populated by the Member Screen when a relevant person is added or updated. During execution, the program reads demographic and identity data from TWNPERSON, along with any associated alternate names and SSNs from TWNALTERNATE_NAME and TWNALTERNATE_SSN. It also queries the TWNLCTE_ACTVY table to determine prior request history and updates it accordingly after successful submission. Worker and case tracking information is gathered by joining TWNIVD_CASELD_CASE and TWNSUP_UNT_POS_HST to derive the appropriate contact details. The program writes output records to the SVES-OP-FILE using the SR-Q-SVES-REC structure, which is formatted for SSA submission. Additionally, it logs all submitted SSNs to the TWNSSN_LOG table and creates tracking entries in the TWNIVD_CONTACTS table for audit purposes. After successful processing, the original trigger entries are removed from the TWNFAM_TRGR_TBL.
