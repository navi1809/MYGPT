This project aims to enhance the renewal and closure process by shifting the monthly cutoff closure cycle from the cutoff night to the 3rd business days prior to the end of certification end date. The objective is to ensure that benefits remain active until the last day of the certification end date.
Currently, the process closes benefits on the cutoff date, generates closure notices, and updates the MMIS interface. If the REDE Form B packet is submitted after the cutoff date but before the certification end date, case workers must initiate the renewal process by performing actions such as "Redetermination." However, if work overload prevents the renewal process from being completed before the certification end date, a coverage gap occurs from the certification end date until renewal is completed.
The new process addresses this issue by running the monthly cutoff closure cycle on the 3rd business days prior to the end of certification end date. It will close only those cases for which REDE Form B is not received by the 3rd business days prior to the end of certification end date. This change ensures that cases do not close prematurely, eliminating the need for case workers to perform " Redetermination" actions if REDE Form B is submitted after the cutoff date but before the end of the certification period, thereby preventing any coverage gaps. Benefits will be systematically reinstated to approve in IES and MMIS and a reinstatement letter will be sent to the client for which REDE Form B is received after the closure cycle.

Cutoff Date Calculation: For each month, cutoff = last
 3rd business day of month (e.g., June 30, cutoff is June 26). 
Note: A new Reference table will be created to determine the monthly closure cycle run date for the new MAMedical closure batch.


o	Benefits will be systematically reinstated to approve in IES and MMEL trigger will be generated to make the benefits eligible/approve in MMIS for which REDE Form B is received after the closure cycle. 
•	The existing batch which runs on the cutoff night of every month to close MAMedical and Cash benefits for cases for which REDE Form B is not received, with the new changes this batch will only pickup cash benefits and will not pickup MAMedical cases.

o	Cutoff Date Calculation: For each month, cutoff = last 3rd business day of month (e.g., for June 30, cutoff is June 26). 
o	Note: A new Reference table will be created to determine the monthly closure cycle run date for the new MAMedical closure batch.
2.2.	Assumptions
•	All necessary resources will be available for the project duration.
•	Stakeholders will provide timely feedback and approvals.
•	No major changes in regulatory requirements during the project timeline.
•	Ensure the batch process is seamlessly integrated with the existing systems.
•	Thoroughly test the new batch process to ensure it correctly identifies and processes cases.
•	Design clear and informative notices to keep clients well-informed about their benefits status.

This project aims to improve the renewal and closure process by moving the monthly cutoff closure cycle from the cutoff night to the 3 business days prior to the end of certification end date. The goal is to keep benefits active until the certification end date. Currently, benefits close on the cutoff date, and if the REDE Form B packet is submitted after the cutoff night but before the certification end date, case workers renew benefits by reopening the case with action “Redetermination”, which can lead to coverage gaps if not completed in time. The new process will only close cases where REDE Form B is not received by the 3 business days prior to the end of certification end date, preventing premature closures, and eliminating coverage gaps if renewal is completed before the certification end date. Benefits will be systematically reinstated to approve in IES and MMIS and a reinstatement letter will be sent to the client for which REDE Form B is received after the closure cycle.
o	Current Process:
•	Cutoff Date (Cutoff night of Certification End Date): 
o	The monthly cutoff closure batch runs on the cutoff night of each month. 
o	Benefits close on the cutoff date for all the cases for which REDE Form B is not received, generating closure notices, and updating the MMIS interface. 
o	If the REDE Form B packet is submitted after the cutoff date but before the certification end date, case workers must perform actions like "Redetermination." 
o	If the renewal process is not completed before the certification end date due to workload, a coverage gap occurs.
o	New Process:
•	New monthly batch date Process (3 business days prior to the end of certification end date): 

o	The monthly cutoff closure cycle will occur on the 3rd business days prior to the end of certification end date. A closure notice will not be sent on this day as its sent on the cutoff night of the certification end month. 
o	Only cases without a received REDE Form B by the 3rd business days prior to the end of certification end date will be closed. 
o	A new closure notice will be sent on cutoff night of the certification end month; however, benefits will be active in IES and in MMIS interface until the new closure cycle runs.

3.2.3.1.	Batch Changes
The proposed changes will require several batch processing adjustments to ensure the new processes are implemented effectively. These potential batch changes are listed below:

Existing batch changes: (AL-ALNFC-MLY)
1.	The existing batch which runs on the cutoff night of every month to close MAMedical and Cash benefits for cases for which REDE Form B is not received, with the new changes this batch will only pickup cash benefits and will not pickup MAMedical cases.
New Batch 1: (AL-XXXXX-MLY)
1.	The proposed new batch process involves running the monthly cutoff closure cycle 3 business days prior to the end of certification end date every month.
2.	This new batch will pick up cases for which the REDE Form B is not received for that specific certification end date.
3.	The batch will close the benefits on the 3rd business days prior to the end of certification end date and MMEL trigger will be generated for closure in MMIS.
New Batch 2: (AL-XXXXX-MLY)
1.	The proposed new batch process involves running the monthly batch cycle on the cutoff night of every month.
2.	This new batch will pick up cases for which REDE Form B has a certification end date of the current month and the REDE Form B received date is not populated to send out the new closure notice.
New Batch 3: (AL-XXXXX-DLY)
1.	The proposed new batch process involves running the batch daily with the nightly batch cycle.
2.	This new batch will pick up cases for which the Medical EDG is closed, and the REDE Form B has a rede received date populated that is prior to the end of the certification period.
3.	This batch will systematically update the benefit status to approve in IES. (Note: Pending for discussion)
4.	This batch will generate MMEL trigger to reopen the previous closed medical benefits in MMIS without extending the certification period.


o	Eligibility Changes
•	Changes to the 'Certification’ page
o	Current functionality: The below error message 40291 is displayed for the case worker when trying to certify benefits beyond current certification period after the BICUTOFF Period when new certification period is generated. 
o	Updated functionality: Error message 40291 will be displayed for the case worker after the medical REDE cut of date only 

40291: Cannot proceed with certification due to presence of the approved EDG beyond the household’s existing certification period.

•	Changes to the Medical Eligibility run in any case mode other then REDE and form B is not yet received. 
o	Current functionality: If the caseworker is running eligibility after the BICUTOFF in any mode benefits are terminated in the ongoing month. 
o	Updated functionality: EDBC will build the new approved segments beyond the current certification period without creating evaluating new certification period. EDBC will build terminated for the ongoing month only after REDE cut of date.

•	Update the validation message below on the certification page to be displayed only after the closure batch. 
o	Initiate data collection
o	EDBC Summary screen. 
o	Case Summary screen.
