Fact-based
Comments should be fact-based and capture the key inputs you considered when assessing your Team Member’s performance in the Snapshot. Comments should only focus on the work and not include any confidential or personal information


Aligned with Check-ins
Comments should be summative and reinforce performance and development feedback themes already shared with your Team Member through Check-in conversations


Actionable
Comments should be clear, meaningful, and actionable, to provide Team Member’s with transparency into their performance evaluation and support Team Members and Coaches in their developmental conversations


Additional Guidance
If evaluating an individual who served in a Team Leader role, provide comments relative to the Team Leader expectations – managing performance/quality of work, modeling inclusive leadership in a team environment, demonstrating empathy and championing well-being, and investing in growth and development.
