The identity and access management approach for each portal—Child Care Provider, Family, and Worker—is comprehensively detailed in the Role-Based Security section above. That section outlines the full authentication flow, role assignment process (including the use of PDS where applicable), admin tools, and access restrictions. The same enterprise security infrastructure and operational workflows described there apply here and provide the foundation for consistent, secure, and auditable system administration across all user types and portals.
