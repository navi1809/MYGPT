i am writing a spring batch where it reads file and do some processing and insert into a table atatched is the existing mainframe batch. I also attached a sample input file. Tere will be a million records the file will have. but if you observe the input file there will be different parts for each medicaid id, like in the sample file you see for this medicaid id 00000000114, there are 14 rows, like wise this pattern will be repeated. it might be 13 or 12 rows for different medicaid id. Now how i will do this in spring batch so that i want to group those medicaid ids together and process them at once and proceed to next medicaid id. also think about performance if we have million records. can you suggest me a better approach.
