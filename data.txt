**Areas to Probe:**  
The candidate has a good understanding of core Java concepts like how memory is used with `Integer.valueOf()` vs `new Integer()`, and how string comparisons work using `==` and `.equals()`. They also handled exception handling basics well, but seemed unsure about what happens when an exception is thrown from a `finally` block. This is an important detail to get right, as it can hide or override other exceptions if not handled properly.

In Spring, they explained the purpose of `@Transactional` correctly but showed only partial understanding of more advanced topics like `PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW`. They could not clearly explain how this changes transaction behavior or when it should be used. Similarly, their explanation of `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` was basic—they knew it helps with performance but didn’t go into how it works under the hood.

One key area they missed was the impact of using a prototype-scoped bean inside a singleton-scoped bean in Spring. This is a common pattern and important to understand to avoid unexpected behavior. Their knowledge of asynchronous vs synchronous REST APIs was also a bit surface-level—they need to be clearer on when each type should be used and how it affects system performance.

**Interviewer’s Recommendation:**  
The candidate shows solid knowledge of Java, Spring, and SQL, and gave correct answers to most of the standard questions. While there are some gaps in more advanced Spring topics and edge cases, these seem like areas that can be improved with guidance. Overall, they appear technically strong and capable of picking up the missing pieces quickly. I recommend moving forward with the candidate for a backend role, with some follow-up or mentoring on Spring internals and transaction handling.
