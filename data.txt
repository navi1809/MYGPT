Apologies for that! Here's a revised, concise version using the correct pronoun:

**Areas to Probe:**  
The candidate was unable to clearly explain key Java concepts such as the difference between `Integer.valueOf(int)` and `new Integer(int)`, and the behavior of exceptions in `finally` blocks. Her understanding of string comparison was also incorrect. In Spring, she mentioned not using `@Transactional` and couldn't explain prototype vs singleton scope behavior. She also lacked clarity on configuring multiple data sources. Angular responses were mostly incorrect—she couldn’t explain two-way binding or lifecycle hooks. SQL knowledge was basic, and her explanation of `WHERE` vs `HAVING` was not clear.

**Interviewer’s Recommendation:**  
The candidate struggled with several core and framework-specific topics and did not demonstrate the depth expected for the role. I do not recommend proceeding with her selection.
