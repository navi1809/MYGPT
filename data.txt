Overall Feedback:
The candidate demonstrated a strong understanding of Java, Spring, and SQL concepts, answering most questions correctly. They showed good knowledge of exception handling, string comparison, Java Streams, and JdbcTemplate. Their grasp of Spring Data JPA and transaction management was decent but had some gaps, particularly in @Transactional, PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW, and rollback policies. Additionally, they partially answered questions on @Modifying vs. @Query and named queries. Their knowledge of RestTemplate was solid, but they missed explaining the exchange method. Overall, they have a good foundation and can refine their expertise in advanced Spring and SQL concepts.

Interviewer's Recommendation:
The candidate is well-versed in Java and Spring fundamentals and would be a good fit for roles requiring strong backend development skills. However, they should focus on deepening their understanding of transaction management, query customization in JPA, and advanced JdbcTemplate usage. Providing them with real-world exposure to prototype beans and custom rollback configurations would be beneficial. If they work on these areas, they can excel in Spring-based applications. I recommend them for consideration, provided they are open to learning and refining their skills in these key areas.
