Based on the questions and the candidate’s responses, it seems there are several key areas where her understanding is weak or incomplete. You should probe her Java fundamentals more deeply, especially around inheritance and method hiding with static methods, increment operators, and HashMap behavior with null keys. She also needs a better grasp of Spring annotations and configurations, such as @RestController, @GetMapping, @Entity, @Id, @Bean, @Primary, and @Qualifier. Additionally, her understanding of JPA repositories and how custom methods are handled in them is lacking. She couldn’t answer questions involving transactions, handling optional values, and basic SQL queries, which shows she may need improvement in working with databases, SQL logic, and exception handling. It would be good to ask follow-up questions in these areas using simpler scenarios to confirm how deep her understanding really goes.
