3.45.1. Role-Based Security Access Process
The proposed Provider Portal will implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) using Azure AD B2C for identity management. Providers will self-register through a secure, mobile-friendly interface, and accounts will remain inactive until reviewed and approved by DWSS staff through a dedicated Admin Portal. Administrators will have the ability to assign roles and control access to specific features, such as attendance submission, payment records, and provider profile updates. Role definitions will be aligned to user types—such as providers, billing contacts, and DWSS reviewers—and permissions will be enforced at the screen and function level. This ensures a secure, least-privileged access model tailored to the needs of both external providers and internal staff.

3.48.1. System Administration Functionality (PDS Integration)
While the Provider Portal will not integrate directly with DWSS’s Personnel Database System (PDS), it will leverage Azure B2C for secure user authentication and centralized profile management. Provider account creation and access are subject to DWSS approval workflows via a separate Admin Portal, enabling internal staff to validate submitted licensure, demographic, and training data before granting access. Administrators can manage provider roles, reset credentials, and update account statuses in real time. This approach ensures strong security controls and administrative oversight while maintaining a clear separation from internal DWSS staff systems managed through PDS.
