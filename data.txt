As Phase II lead for the ESU Modernization project ($12.18M), I managed a 30-member team migrating 200 components—including Benefit Issuance, Case Management, Interfaces, Reports, and Worker Portal screens—from mainframe to Java and Crystal Reports. The project is currently in UAT and on track for a February 2026 go-live, enabling full decommissioning of the legacy system and long-term operational cost savings. Post go-live, I am ensuring a seamless transition into Phase II M&O and readiness for Phase III Modernization through proactive staffing, knowledge transition, and operational planning. In parallel, I managed Child Care and Medicaid M&O engagements totaling over $2.15M, leading two 5-member teams to deliver monthly production releases within fixed timelines. Leveraging strong technical expertise and deep functional knowledge, I directly engage with clients on core correspondence and solution design, serving as a trusted point of contact for critical decisions.


I consistently demonstrated strong leadership by managing, mentoring, and developing teams across modernization and M&O programs. I currently lead a 30-person cross-functional team and serve as manager for 10 team members across Child Care and Medicaid M&O projects. My responsibilities include staffing, sprint planning, effort estimation, task delegation, performance management, and daily client coordination. I complete approximately 18 performance snapshots in every cycle, enabling continuous feedback and development; as a result, two team members are on track for Lead-level promotions and three are on track for Consultant promotions. Additionally, I coach five team members through regular monthly touchpoints, providing career guidance and role clarity, with four currently on track for promotion this year.


I contributed to account growth by supporting the Nevada account as part of the future sales group, where I identified system productivity gaps, proposed modernization solutions, and provided pre-sale and post-engagement estimates that strengthened client confidence and helped sustain ongoing work. In addition, I supported project staffing needs by participating in technical interviews aligned with client and delivery requirements, from firm-level recruitment activities i took 33 interviews. Due to the scale and complexity of multiple concurrent modernization and M&O engagements this year, my primary focus remained on delivery excellence and client commitments, which limited participation in broader firm initiatives.


I delivered strong, measurable performance outcomes across utilization, revenue, and delivery metrics. My year-to-date utilization stands at 99%, significantly exceeding the goal, with 1,746 billable. I supported and delivered work across multiple funded engagements, including ESU Modernization Phase II ($12.18M), Medicaid M&O ($2.0M), and PARIS ($152K). By balancing large-scale modernization leadership with critical M&O responsibilities, I consistently optimized billable contribution, ensured delivery continuity, and maximized value for both the client and the firm.
