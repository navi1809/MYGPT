We had a major Go Live for Modernization Phase 1 project on 16th August, 2024 and multiple important milestones every weekend after that. It was a work the team was doing for past 1.5 Years. This was a major step in getting this out of Mainframe.
 
We had below components as part of the release.
 
1.	Posting (Case Authorization) Module : Migrated module from Mainframe to Java platform with Spring. Very critical module for Business as lot of data updates happens when a case is Posted.
2.	Eligibility Data Loader moved from Mainframe to BPM (Java) platform as part of plan to shut down mainframe. In Nevada, the IBM BPM and Rule Engine (IBM ODM) are integrated.
3.	Additional Worker Portal Screens: Remaining Maintenance screens from Mainframe are migrated to Worker Portal which included a lot of Administrative, Maintenance screens, Interview Scheduling, System Alerts for Workers, etc.
4.	Batches :
1.	Mass Change Batch: process This was an important optimization introduced as part of this project. Legacy process redetermined eligibility for ongoing cases with Federal Poverty Limit changes every Fiscal. We used a rule driven approach, to decide whether to directly extend eligibility or re-determine full eligibility. This will save Infrastructure resources and a lot of Business hours as full eligibility could require worker intervention for verifications.
2.	Carry Forward Batch: Monthly Batch to extend the eligibility every month for SNAP, TANF, Medicaid programs
 
Some Metrics since Go Live:
Module	Metrics
Posting	150K cases posted via the new posting module
Data Loader	Eligibility determination for 350K cases via the new Data Loader
Carry Forward Batch	0.6 million Eligibility Versions got carry forwarded across SNAP, TANF, Medicaid programs
Mass Change Batch	Recalculated eligibility for 160K cases SNAP cases via Mass Change Batch. This batch saved lot of efforts for Workers and Operation team. Similar Runs to be completed for Medicaid around February.
