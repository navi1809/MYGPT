In the Foot Locker project, though involved only for a short duration this year, he delivered meaningful impact by independently building 4 integrations and 2 skeletons with high quality. His solutions improved system performance and reduced connector usage through optimized scripting. He also supported peers and ensured seamless handover before transitioning out.

In the PxE_Tax engagement, he has been a key contributor handling 12+ complex integrations end-to-end, covering high-concurrency flows, vendor systems, and tax-related APIs. He works with minimal supervision, collaborates directly with clients and BI teams, and consistently delivers ahead of timelines. He improved performance through reusable scripts, optimized connector use, and solved critical technical blockers for team members. His contribution spans design, development, POCs, automation, and mentoring—operating at a consultant-level in ownership, quality, and technical depth.

His promotion readiness is validated by multiple examples of consultant-level ownership. In PxE_Tax, he independently delivered 12+ complex integrations, built reusable scripts to solve team-wide issues, created POCs on new connectors, AWS Secret Manager, and Boomi cache, and directly collaborated with clients. In Foot Locker, even in a short period this year, he delivered high-quality integrations and ensured smooth handover. He is the go-to person when the team is stuck on custom scripting or performance tuning.

For further growth, the focus areas discussed include increasing visibility in planning and design discussions and proactively leading small groups or workstreams. Strengthening documentation and client presentation skills will further enhance his impact. With guidance in these areas, he is well-positioned for a consultant role.

She has consistently delivered impact far beyond her role expectations by managing highly complex EDI integrations, particularly around Passive Renewals and system enhancements. She operates as a primary owner, independently driving end-to-end design, development, impact analysis, and implementation without dependency on leads. Her work spans migration of EDI from BizTalk to Azure Integration Services, automation of issuer reinstatement, dispute resolution systems between CMS, State, and Issuer, and quick resolution of performance and production defects. She plays a critical role in cross-team coordination, stakeholder communication, and initiating requirement discussions. Alongside delivery, she mentors new team members, leads KT sessions, and ensures seamless onboarding. Her strong technical depth, reliability, and ability to manage high-stakes work make her a key contributor for the long-term M&O engagement and reflect readiness for a Consultant-level role.

She demonstrates strong leadership through ownership, collaboration and proactive engagement. She independently drives complex EDI enhancements, coordinates with multiple stakeholders (CMS, State, Issuers, tech teams), and ensures alignment without relying on leads. She actively initiates discussions to clarify requirements and resolve dependencies. Beyond her own delivery, she supports team members by conducting KT sessions, onboarding new joiners, sharing documentation, and helping resolve technical or functional blockers. Her ability to stay calm, communicate clearly across teams, and enable others shows maturity and leadership readiness for the next level.
