3.45. ROLE BASED SECURITY
3.45.1. Role-Based Security Access Process
Our proposed solution will integrate seamlessly with DWSS’s existing Personnel Database System (PDS) and security infrastructure to implement a robust, customizable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework. This ensures that DWSS administrators can effectively manage user access and assign security roles aligned with organizational responsibilities.

Administrators will have secure interfaces to:

Define and assign user roles based on job functions, office structures, and service responsibilities.

Configure permissions that control access to specific system features, including individual screens, reports, and case information.

Apply the principle of least privilege to ensure users can only access the minimum set of data and functionality necessary for their role.

Set restrictions based on geographic or operational boundaries (e.g., restricting task visibility or document access to within an assigned office or contracted area).

The system will also support audit logs and administrative tracking to ensure transparency in user role assignments and changes. Access roles will be regularly synchronized with DWSS’s security protocols to maintain up-to-date permissions as staff transitions occur.

3.48. SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION FUNCTIONALITY
3.48.1. Integration with DWSS Security and PDS
The proposed solution is designed to align with DWSS’s security model by integrating directly with the Personnel Database System (PDS) and existing DWSS authentication services. This allows for centralized and streamlined management of user profiles, roles, and access levels across the system.

Key functionalities include:

Leveraging DWSS’s identity and access management infrastructure for single sign-on (SSO) via SAML federation.

Automatic user provisioning and de-provisioning based on PDS updates to reflect staff onboarding, role changes, or terminations.

Real-time synchronization of user roles and access levels with PDS to ensure consistent and secure access control throughout the system lifecycle.

Support for granular access policies tied to user job roles, ensuring staff only access cases, provider data, and reports relevant to their assigned duties and locations.

Administrators will also have visibility into user activity and security configurations, promoting compliance and enabling proactive security governance. This ensures that user access is both auditable and aligned with DWSS’s compliance and service delivery models.
